## Task 1: Student Grade Calculator

Create a Go console application that allows students to calculate their average grade based on different subjects. The application should prompt the student to enter their name and the number of subjects they have taken. For each subject, the student should enter the subject name and the grade obtained (numeric value). After entering all subjects and grades, the application should display the student's name, individual subject grades, and the calculated average grade.

#### Requirements:

- Use variables and data types to store student data.
- Use conditional statements to validate input (e.g., ensure grade values are within a valid range).
- Implement loops to handle multiple subjects and grades.
- Utilize collections (e.g., List, Dictionary) to store subject names and corresponding grades.
- Define a method to calculate the average grade based on the entered grades.
- Use string interpolation to display the results in a user-friendly format.
- Write test for your code [Optional]

## Task 2: Fundamentals of Go

### Sub Task 1: Word Frequency Count

- Write a Go function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the string. Treat words in a case-insensitive manner and ignore punctuation marks.
- Write test for your function

### Sub Task 2: Word Frequency Count

- Write a Go function that takes a string as input and checks whether it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
- Write test for your function
